Alki's Special Coffee with Almonds and Chocolate Hexagons

I once worked at an Australian bank as a financial planner. For a time I domiciled at a branch in Camberwell, Melbourne, which shared a wall with a little spot called the Book Shop Cafe, famous for the disproportionately large crowd it pulled in the mornings and at lunch time. The reason was Alki.

Alki Manasis is a charismatic Greek Australian man who teaches traditional Greek dance and nurtures and shares a special happiness with the world. He also makes the best coffee I've ever tasted.

The 'Alki Special' is a shot of espresso coffee with a dollop if quality thick chocolate sauce hidden within the shot.

Alki would lay out a small side of raw almonds onto the saucer, fresh from the nearby market, along with a few hexagonal dark chocolate buttons intended as premium cooking chocolate pastilles, but better than any chocolate you could remember while you ate them.



The Recipe:

The only two secrets to the recipe are:
	- exactly how Alki extracted his espresso shots
	- if you must enjoy it alone, think of the smile on a friend's face when last you saw it
